/**
 * What Agents on a Task may actually do.
 *
 * Two sources, in this order: the grant recorded on the Task, and an operator
 * preset in the environment. The Task grant is the normal path — it is made
 * after the work is understood, and it is durable, so an Agent's permissions
 * are answerable later. The environment exists for a run that is configured
 * ahead of time, such as a benchmark harness or an unattended job.
 *
 * The default is the sandbox: an Agent writes only its own directory, runs
 * commands without a shell, and retries a failed delegation. Nothing here
 * grants anything on its own; something has to say so.
